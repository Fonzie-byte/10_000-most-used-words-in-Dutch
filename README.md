# The 10.000 most used words in Dutch
The words in this list come from the list hosted on [Liam Rosen's site](http://www.liamrosen.com/files/10000mostfrequentdutchwords.txt).

There are 4 lists:
1. The full list Liam Rosen hosted
1. The lowercased version of the list without duplicates (such as &ldquo;de&rdquo; and &ldquo;De&rdquo;)
1. The previous list, without diatrics (such as &ldquo;&eacute;&rdquo;), then those duplicates removed (such as &ldquo;geen&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&eacute;&eacute;n&rdquo;) and then without all single-letter &ldquo;words&rdquo;; with the exception of &ldquo;u&rdquo; (which is the formal version of &ldquo;you&rdquo; in Dutch)
1. The top 7776 most used words from the last list with Diceware-numbers in front

I personally use this to make a better Dutch [diceware passphrase](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html), since the [original Dutch list](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/DicewareDutch.txt) contains amazing entries such as 
`3`, `qx`, and `@` and `@@`; making `@ qx 3 @@ c f` a perfectly valid &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; passphrase.

The first list was put up here in case Liam Rosen's site should ever go down; the last three lists, containing only sensible Dutch words and abbreviations, are here for research and passphrasing purposes.
